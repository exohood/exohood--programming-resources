# Contribution guidelines

* First and most importantly those are my personal bookmarks and I will add submitted *book/article/tutorial* only if it seems interesting to me. If you disagree feel free to fork the repository.

* Currently the list does not contain video *tutorials/courses* but only text ones. 

* All resources have to be freely available on the internet by their authors. Links to pirate content are not accepted.

* Make sure that submitted resource is not already included in the list.

* Place the link in the appropriate section or make a new section if appropriate.

* Keep resource titles and section titles in lexicographic order.

* The pull request needs to have a descriptive title.

* Make a separate pull request for each of the resources.

* Use the format `[Title](link_to_resource)`.

* Do not include trailing `/` character from the URL.

* Add the names of the author(s) of the resource after the link in *italic* if known.

* If the resource is multi-part series and the resource does not have an index section use the following format except the case that the parts are *too many*:
```
* Title
  * [Part 1](link_to_part_1)
  * [Part 2](link_to_part_2)
```

* If the title of the resource is not enough self-explanatory add a short description after it.
